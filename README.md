# Museum Of Hunt
Here is a simple HTML webpage with the emphasis on practicing my CSS and Bootstrap skills. The actual words on the page are gibberish and the links lead to nowhere but this doesn't focus on those aspects. I have used bootstrap to make the website more responsive than with simple CSS.

As you scroll down the page, the nav bar gets a dark border around it and it sticks to the top of the page. This was done so that in the begginning there would be space to see the full image on top.

There are also accomodations made for the smaller screens such as a phone. As the screen shrinks the font and images change to reflect said change. The navigation bar shrinks and a button is displayed which when clicked will show the rest of the links.
